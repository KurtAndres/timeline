Kurt Andres Work

2/5/14 Group had first meeting, began work on implementing the event. I decided to use an interface so the group has an api they can call. Then implemented getter and setter methods for Atomic and Duration Events.
2/9/14 Built timeline as hashTree and began to implement methods for add, remove, display, save, and load.
